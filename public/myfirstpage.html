                                In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat
                                him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's <strong>impossible</strong>
                                to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and <strong>not</strong>
                                love them the way they love themselves.

                                To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to
                                find each other and to feel. <strong>That is the purpose of life.</strong>

                                Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, <strong>doesn’t mean they’re
                                lost forever.</strong>

                                Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain’t how hard you can hit. It’s how hard
                                you can get hit and keep moving forward. It’s how much you can take, and keep moving
                                forward. <strong>That’s how winning is done.</strong>

                                Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who
                                died for no reason while the guilty ran free? Okay. <strong>Fine</strong>. Forget the one offs. How
                                about the countless wars declared in his name? Okay. <strong>Fine</strong>. Let's skip the random,
                                meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup
                                we've all been drowning in because of him? And I'm not just talking about Jesus. I'm
                                talking about all organized religions. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A
                                dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts
                                who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance.
                                <strong>Addicts.</strong>
                                Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions
                                are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to <strong>divide</strong> us so it's easier
                                to <strong>rule</strong> us by the charlatans that wanna <strong>run</strong> us. All
                                we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't
                                listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think
                                their worship's some key to happiness. <strong>That's just how he owns you.</strong>
                                Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He's not
                                a good enough scapegoat for me.

                                I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and
                                at times hard to handle. <strong>But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure
                                as hell don't deserve me at my best.</strong>
